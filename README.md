üé≤ Fun Fact:
When I'm not immersed in building fraud detection models or dissecting datasets, you might catch me sailing the sun-drenched Mediterranean (yes, I have a skipper license!) or producing electronic music in Ableton Live. I truly believe that the most innovative solutions emerge when analytical rigor meets creative exploration.
